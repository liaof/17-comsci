### Building Blocks of JS
![](./Images/400-javascript-parts.png)</br>An example of how each part plays a role in how Javascript works.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript is comprised of three data structures: a stack, a queue, and a heap.
Stack and Queue are linear data structures because they have a start and end. A heap is a 
2D structure with a hierarchical organization.
#### Call Stack
This data structure adds and removes data from only one end of the structure, like taking chips out a 
Pringles can. This type of operation is called FILO: First in, Last out
The pop() method removes items from the same end targeted by push.
#### Callback Queue
This data structure adds data at one end of the structure and removes data from the other, like water
flowing through a garden hose. This type of operation is called FIFO: First in, First out
The shift() method removes items from the front of the array queue and push adds elements to the end.
